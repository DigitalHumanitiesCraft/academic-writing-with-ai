## Title (working)
"Hermeneutic Workflows: Integrating Large Language Models into Interpretive Practice"

## Thesis
LLMs cannot interpret texts, but they can be productively integrated into human interpretive workflows when researchers maintain epistemic authority and document AI contributions transparently.

## Structure

### 1. Introduction (~800 words)
- Hook: The interpretive turn meets generative AI
- Problem: Existing frameworks don't account for LLMs
- Contribution: A workflow model for hermeneutic AI use

### 2. Background (~1500 words)
- Digital hermeneutics: Capurro to Romele
- What LLMs do (and don't do)
- The interpretation question

### 3. A Workflow Model (~2000 words)
- Preparation: Human sets interpretive frame
- Exploration: AI as interlocutor
- Distillation: Human synthesizes
- Implementation: Iterative drafting

### 4. Case Study (~2000 words)
- Applying the workflow to [specific corpus]
- What the AI contributed
- What required human judgment

### 5. Discussion (~1200 words)
- Implications for DH practice
- Limitations and risks
- Future directions

### 6. Conclusion (~500 words)
