# My Academic Positions

## Core Commitments
- Digital methods augment but don't replace humanistic interpretation
- Transparency about tool limitations is an ethical obligation
- Reproducibility matters even in qualitative work

## Contested Views I Hold
- Close reading and distant reading are complementary, not opposed
- AI-assisted analysis is continuous with earlier computational methods
- The "black box" critique of ML is often overstated

## What I Won't Argue
- That AI replaces human judgment in interpretation
- That quantitative methods are superior to qualitative ones
- That traditional humanities methods are obsolete
