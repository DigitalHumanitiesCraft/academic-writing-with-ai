# Research Context

## The Gap
Most digital hermeneutics scholarship predates LLMs. Existing frameworks assume rule-based or statistical NLP. LLMs introduce new interpretive possibilities that require theoretical updating.

## Key Sources

### Capurro (2010) - "Digital Hermeneutics"
- Foundational framing of the field
- Argues digital texts require new interpretive approaches
- Limitation: written before deep learning revolution

### Romele (2020) - "Digital Hermeneutics"
- Most comprehensive recent treatment
- Connects Ricoeur's hermeneutics to digital methods
- Doesn't address generative AI

### Drucker (2021) - "The Digital Humanities Coursebook"
- Practical orientation to DH methods
- Chapter on interpretation useful for framing
- Not theoretically deep on hermeneutics

## My Intervention
Bridge the gap between hermeneutic theory and LLM capabilities. Argue that LLMs don't interpret but can participate in interpretive workflows when properly constrained.
