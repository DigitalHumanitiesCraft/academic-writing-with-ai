# Romele (2020) - Digital Hermeneutics

**Citation:** Romele, A. (2020). *Digital Hermeneutics: Philosophical Investigations in New Media and Technologies*. Routledge.

## Key Arguments
- Extends Ricoeur's hermeneutics to digital contexts
- Argues for "technological mediation" of interpretation
- Digital tools shape what we can interpret and how

## Useful Quotes
> "The hermeneutic circle is now a hermeneutic spiral that includes technological mediations." (p. 87)

## My Notes
- Most sophisticated recent treatment
- Doesn't address generative AI specifically
- His framework can accommodate LLMs with modification
- Use his "mediation" concept to frame AI role
