# Capurro (2010) - Digital Hermeneutics

**Citation:** Capurro, R. (2010). Digital hermeneutics: An outline. *AI & Society*, 25(1), 35-42.

## Key Arguments
- Digital texts are not simply digitized versions of analog texts
- They exist in networks of links, metadata, and algorithmic processes
- This requires adapting hermeneutic theory

## Useful Quotes
> "Digital hermeneutics deals with the impact of digital technology on understanding and interpretation." (p. 36)

> "The question is not whether machines can think but how human thinking changes when it takes place within digital environments." (p. 40)

## My Notes
- Foundational but dated—predates deep learning
- Good for establishing the field's lineage
- Need to update his framework for LLMs
