# My Writing Style

## Preferences
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Topic sentences that state the point
- Evidence → interpretation → implication structure
- Minimize hedging language ("seems to suggest" → "suggests")

## Pet Peeves
- Passive voice obscuring agency
- "It is interesting to note that..."
- Unnecessarily complex sentences
- Overuse of semicolons

## Sample Paragraph (my voice)
Digital hermeneutics requires us to reconsider what "reading" means when the reader is an algorithm. Traditional interpretation assumes a human subject encountering a text. AI systems process texts differently—not worse, not better, but differently. This difference matters for how we design interpretive workflows.
