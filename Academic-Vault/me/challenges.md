# Challenges to My Thinking

## Steelman Arguments Against My Position

### "AI interpretation is fundamentally different from human interpretation"
The strongest version: Human interpretation involves embodied experience, cultural embeddedness, and phenomenological encounter with texts. AI systems lack all of these. Calling what AI does "interpretation" is a category error that obscures more than it reveals.

### "Transparency is impossible with current AI systems"
Even with careful documentation, we cannot fully explain why an LLM produces specific outputs. This isn't a solvable engineering problem—it's inherent to how these systems work. Claims of "transparency" are therefore misleading.

### "The reproducibility standard doesn't fit humanistic work"
Humanistic interpretation is inherently situated and perspectival. Importing reproducibility from the sciences imposes inappropriate epistemological standards that distort humanistic inquiry.

## Open Questions I Haven't Resolved
- Where exactly is the line between "augmentation" and "replacement"?
- How do we evaluate AI-assisted interpretations that humans wouldn't have reached?
- What counts as sufficient documentation for AI-assisted research?
